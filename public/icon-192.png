<!-- This is a placeholder for a 192x192 PNG icon. In production, you would generate this from the SVG -->
<!-- To generate PNG from SVG, you can use tools like:
     - Online converters (svgtopng.com, cloudconvert.com)
     - Command line tools (rsvg-convert, imagemagick)
     - Design software (Figma, Illustrator, Inkscape)
     
     For now, we'll use the SVG version which is supported by modern browsers -->
